# MGS CAD Files

Here I will be sharing .STEP files that I created or found on the internet.  These should prove useful for anyone looking to create their own custom arcade or game hardware. 

*When saving .step files remember to right click and save as.  Normally downloading will turn the .step file into a .txt file.
